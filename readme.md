# php unit converter

a simple web application to test out php and its form handling

honestly it's a 6/10, javascript allows me to do basically the same thing while keeping the code in one file and keeping it simple, but it's cool to write both server side code and front-end code in the same file without having a large react project for example or running a separate backend.
